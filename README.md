### What is PruneStack ###

* A simple QML plugin for MuseScore to prune notes from a chord stack selection.
* This is a great tool for arrangers and orchestrators!
* prunestack-2x.qml is compatible with MuseScore 2.x
* prunestack-3x.qml is compatible with MuseScore 3.x
* prunestack-4x.qml is compatible with MuseScore 4.x
* Rob Birdwell is the original author of this script, based in part on other examples.
* Please contribute and make this plugin even better!

### Installation ###
* Copy the appropriate qml script to your plugins folder (you should manually create the "prunestack" folder under "Plugins"
* Example (your "Users" folder will be different!): C:\Users\Rob Birdwell\Documents\MuseScore4\Plugins\prunestack
* Copy the prunestack.png file into the "prunestack" folder of the plugins folder.
* You may need to restart MuseScore to see the list of plugins - by default the plugin is disabled and you need to enable it.
